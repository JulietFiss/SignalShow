 <h1>Welch Window</h1>

 <p>The Welch apodization window is a downward-sloping parabola
 that is zero outside of its x-intercepts.</p>

 <p align="center"><img src="welchwindow.png"></p>

<p> Apodization windows are used when taking the FFT of discrete data. 
The FFT assumes that the N-sample array
is periodic. If this is not the case, the resulting transform will exhibit 
"false" frequency content known as "leakage" due to the discontinuity at the
 edges of the array. Apodization windows have zero amplitude (or nearly so) 
 at the array "edges", and may be used to modulate nonperiodic input 
 to ensure that the product function is periodic over N samples.
