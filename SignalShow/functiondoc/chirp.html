 <h1>Chirp</h1>

 <p>The chirp is an oscillating function whose frequency varies with position. 
 The functional form of a chirp is a sinusoid whose argument (phase) is a 
 monomial (such as a quadratic or cubic function). Because the frequency of a 
 sinusoid is proportional to the derivative of its phase, and the phase varies spatially, the chirp function
 has a frequency that also varies spatially. The most commonly used
 chirp function is the quadratic phase chirp, whose frequency varies linearly with position.</p>
