 <h1>Complex Chirp</h1>

 <p>The complex chirp is an oscillating function whose frequency varies with position. 
 The functional form of a complex chirp is a complex exponential whose argument (phase) is a 
 monomial (such as a quadratic or cubic function). Because the frequency of a 
 complex exponential is proportional to the derivative of its phase, and the phase varies spatially, the chirp function
 has a frequency that also varies spatially. The most commonly used
 chirp function is the quadratic phase chirp, whose frequency varies linearly with position.
 The real part of the complex chirp is an even "cosine chirp" and the imaginary part
 is an odd "sine chirp", which is -90&deg; out of phase with the real part. The complex chirp has a constant magnitude.</p>
 
 <p>To edit the complex chirp function, edit the parameters of either the real or imaginary part. 
 The parameters of the other part will automatically update.</p>
